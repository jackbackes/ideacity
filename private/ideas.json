			"ideaDescription": "We have thousands of people moving to Dallas each year.  As a transplant myself I find that I gravitate towards other transplants because they are willing to embrace me and make a place for me.  Historically rooted people, groups and institutions are only willing to open their arms to newcomers if they adopt the Dallas way.   As a city of innovation we need to be open to the new ways of doing things and experiences that are coming with all our new neighbors. ",
